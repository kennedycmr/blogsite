# Overview

This repository is the undelying code used to deploy my blog.

## Acceptance Criteria

The basic design needs to meet the following: 

* Inexpensive to host publicly.
* Easy to publish new blogs/articles.
* Preferable if the articles can understand markdown.
* Minimal public traffic. (likely just used by me)
* Preferable if it can use IaC and I can own the code and take with me. (no vendor lock-in)
